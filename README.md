# showtimes-rs

A big rewrite in progress...

## Requirements

The following project was built with the following requirements in mind:
- Rust `1.80.0` or newer
- MongoDB 6.x or newer
- Redis/Valkey 7.x or newer (Redis 7.4+ CE is NOT supported/recommended)
- Meilisearch 1.8.x or newer
- ClickHouse 24.x
- S3-compatible storage (e.g. MinIO, AWS S3, Wasabi, etc.) [`Optional`]

### MSRV

The minimum supported Rust version is `1.80.0` since we utilize the new [`LazyLock`](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/07/25/Rust-1.80.0.html) feature that 
recently was stabilized in Rust `1.80.0`.

## Usages
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `cargo build --release --all`
3. Do configuration using `config.toml` file (see `config.toml.example` for reference)
4. Build the binary with `cargo build --locked --release --bin showtimes`
   - Or use the `--profile production` flag for a more optimized build
5. Run the binary with: `./target/release/showtimes`
   - Or in Windows: `.\target\release\showtimes.exe`
6. Access the API at `http://127.0.0.1:5560` by default
